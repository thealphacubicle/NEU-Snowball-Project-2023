## Motivation
Time is money. And when it comes to the wine indsutry, time plays a major role in getting premium selections out to the general public. With the industry
consistently growing, it's important to stay on top of consumer's choices. That's exactly what this project is about! We intend to use Machine Learning to
be able to predict what wine selections consumers would like.
